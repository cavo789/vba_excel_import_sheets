# Excel - Import sheets

![Banner](./banner.svg)

## Situation

Sometimes, Excel doesn't want anymore to open a file : even when trying to open it with `open and repair`, nothing happens.

The file is probably corrupt but it would be really nice if you can retrieve (import) your worksheets from that corrupt file to a new one.

## Description

The VBA code below will try to :

- open the workbook (called `wb`)
- if success,
  _ create a new workbook (called `wbNew`)
  _ loop for all worksheets in `wb`
  _ copy the sheet into `wbNew`
  _ close `wb` \* activate `wbNew` so you can verify, ... and save it.

This VBA piece of code will only do that : try to retrieve worksheets so willn't retrieve modules, settings, names, charts, ...

```vbnet
Public Sub DoIt()

Dim sFileName As String
Dim wb As Workbook, wbNew As Workbook
Dim shSource As Worksheet, shTarget As Worksheet

	sFileName = 'full-name-to-your-corrupt-file.xlsx'

	If (Dir(sFileName) = "") Then
		MsgBox "Sorry this file doesn't exists", vbCritical
		Exit Sub
	End If

	Set wbNew = Application.Workbooks.Add

	Application.EnableEvents = False
	Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual
	Application.ScreenUpdating = True

	Set wb = Workbooks.Open(Filename:=sFileName, UpdateLinks:=False, ReadOnly:=True)

	If (wb Is Nothing) Then
		MsgBox "Sorry the file seems to be corrupt, Workbooks.Open() has failed", vbCritical
		Exit Sub
	End If

	For Each sh In wb.Worksheets

		Application.StatusBar = "Import sheet [" & sh.Name & "] from [" & wb.Name & "]"

		On Error Resume Next

		Call sh.Copy(Before:=wbNew.Worksheets(wbNew.Worksheets.Count))

		If Err.Number <> 0 Then
			MsgBox "Error " & sh.Name & " : " & Err.Description, vbCritical
			Err.Clear
		End If

	Next

	Call wb.Close(SaveChanges:=False)
	Set wb = Nothing

	wbNew.Activate

	MsgBox "Sheets copied from " & sFileName & " to the current workbook", vbInformation

	Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic
	Application.EnableEvents = True

End Sub
```
